# ComposePilot

ComposePilot is a GitOps tool for synthesizing and deploying docker compose stacks to a single host. It's an alternative to a single-node cdk8s+flux+k3s setup.

I hacked this together in like two hours with little to no regard for maintainability or cleanliness. It is not production-ready by any means and does not reflect my level of skill.
